# Welcome to mysite!

Thanks for visiting. This site will have some basic, beginner friendly Python
specific tutorials. The style of the tutorials will be interesting and hope you
enjoy the tone. Think of this site as your one-stop shop of collections of
Cheat sheets for Python and other Opensource tools I use and convincing you to
use them as well. Truth be told, I'm building this website to keep my notes I
have in my dozens of Jupyter notebooks on my 5+ year Macbook on the internet
where we all know it'll be safe! You'll also find these posts on my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/mrcartoonster). Though chances are you were redirected from that page to here. Welcome! Otherwise check out my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/mrcartoonster) page if you like their aesthetique. I do.

## What you'll find

I'll be sharing some of my favorite Python packages and quick tutorials on how
to use them. My personal quick start tutorials for these packages. They won't be
deep dives but more kiddy pool dept tutorials. I'll link to other guides or sections in the package's documentation
that will go deeper to show what else it can do. Basically, my posts will be a
quickstart and I'll give you the cliff notes in the documentation so you won't
be starting at square one. 

## Format

The format of the posts are going to be very *TLDR*(To long, didn't read)
style. I'll post the main code, formulas and syntax at the top with a quick
summary. Below that I'll go over the topic(s) you'll learn and the takeaways.
I'll then point to further reading on the subject. My posts will be formatted
like a [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) tutorial just with 95% shorter.
Chances are I'll link to a related Real Python tutorial if you want to go
deeper. Also, I'll be honest. This site is just practice in writing tutorials
so I can have samples to show Real Python that I can write Python articles and
to give me a job
